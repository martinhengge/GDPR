Additionally, the company had not established and documented deadlines for deletion of personal data in their new CRM system. The deadlines set for the old system were not deleted after the deadline for the information had been reached. Also, the controller had not adequately documented its personal data deletion procedures. 

Please note: Since Danish law does not provide for administrative fines as in the GDPR (unless it is an uncomplicated case and the accused person consented), fines will be imposed by courts. 

Update: On February 12, 2021 the Aarhus District Court decided to impose a fine against IDdesign in the amount of EUR 13,450. With regard to the calculation of the fine, the court disagreed with the proposed amount of the fine. It concluded that the amount should be calculated on the basis of the company's own turnover and not that of the entire group. In addition, the court considered that the mitigating circumstances under Art. 83 (2) GDPR should be taken into account when calculating the fine. Such as that the company had not previously breached the GDPR, as well as that the breach concerned only general personal data. In addition, no data subject suffered damages as a result of the breach. Finally, the court considers that the negligent nature of the breach should be taken into account.";https://www.datatilsynet.dk/tilsyn-og-afgoerelser/afgoerelser/2019/jun/tilsyn-med-iddesigns-behandling-af-personoplysninger/

In addition, the company stored the documentation provided by candidates for longer than necessary.

The bank initially justified this by stating that it was obliged under the German Banking Act to take security measures against customers suspected of money laundering. The Berlin supervisory authority judged this to be illegal. The authority argues that in order to prevent a new bank account from being opened, only those affected may be included in a comparison file who are actually suspected of money laundering or for whom there are other valid reasons for refusing a new bank account.

NAIH levied a fine against an unnamed financial institution for unlawfully rejecting a customer?s request to have his phone number erased after arguing that it was in the company's legitimate interest to process this data in order to enforce a debt claim against the customer. In its decision, the NAIH emphasised that the customer?s phone number is not necessary for the purpose of debt collection because the creditor can also communicate with the debtor by post. Consequently, keeping the phone number of the debtor was against the principles of data minimisation and purpose limitation.

As mandated by law, the fine was based on 4% of the party's annual turnover and 2.65 % of its anticipated turnover for the coming year.

The breach was the result of a cyber attack by an anonymous hacker who accessed and disclosed information on the vulnerability of the organisation?s system ? a database of more than 6,000 individuals ? and the command used for the attack.

It is worth it to mention that the proceeding initiated before May 2018, but the Italian data protection authority issued a fine under the GDPR since the Rousseau platform had not adopted security measures required by means of an order issued after the 25th of May 2018.

The authority verified incompliance with the information obligation in relation to natural persons conducting business activity ? entrepreneurs who are currently conducting such activity or have suspended it, as well as entrepreneurs who conducted such activity in the past. The controller fulfilled the information obligation by providing the information required under Art. 14 (1) ? (3) of the GDPR only in relation to the persons whose e-mail addresses it had at its disposal. In case of the remaining persons the controller failed to comply with the information obligation ? as it explained in the course of the proceedings ? due to high operational costs. Therefore, it presented the information clause only on its website. According to the UODO this is not sufficient.

Addendum: In the meantime, the court has cancelled the fine due to procedural errors. The amount of the fine has to be determined by the concrete number of data records concerned. However, the Office had not submitted any verifiable evidence in this regard, but had simply assumed that 6 million data sets were involved, which the data controller had denied. Therefore, important statements were missing. In particular, it was incorrect to justify the amount of the fine on the basis of general preventive considerations.

The proposed fine relates to a cyber incident notified to the ICO by British Airways in September 2018. This incident in part involved user traffic to the British Airways website being diverted to a fraudulent site. Through this false site, customer details were harvested by the attackers. Personal data of approximately 500,000 customers were compromised in this incident, which is believed to have begun in June 2018. The ICO?s investigation has found that a variety of information was compromised by poor security arrangements at the company, including log in, payment card, and travel booking details as well name and address information.

In the meantime, the final fine imposed on the airline has been set at L20 million (approximately EUR 22,046,000). The ICO emphasized that when setting the amount of the fine, it also took into account the economic impact of the COVID-19 ('Coronavirus') pandemic on the airline industry.";https://ico.org.uk/action-weve-taken/enforcement/british-airways/

A variety of personal data contained in approximately 339 million guest records globally were exposed by the incident, of which around 30 million related to residents of 31 countries in the European Economic Area (EEA). Seven million related to UK residents.

It is believed the vulnerability began when the systems of the Starwood hotels group were compromised in 2014. Marriott subsequently acquired Starwood in 2016, but the exposure of customer information was not discovered until 2018. The ICO?s investigation found that Marriott failed to undertake sufficient due diligence when it bought Starwood and should also have done more to secure its systems.

--> Update: On 2020/10/30, the ICO announced its final decision to impose a fine of L 18.4 million (approximately EUR 20.4 million) on Marriott International Inc. In its decision, the ICO set forth its considerations for the calculation of the fine, which included Marriott's absence of prior violations or omissions and the fact that Marriott had fully cooperated with the investigation and had taken steps to notify the individuals concerned. In addition, the ICO noted that it had also made an alignment with other fines already imposed on other companies - in particular also of other European data protection authorities.";https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/mpns/2618524/marriott-international-inc-mpn-20201030.pdf

The fine was imposed against the school which had used facial recognition technology to monitor the attendance of students. Even though, in general, data processing for the purpose of monitoring attendance is possible doing so with facial recognition is disproportioned to the goal to monitor attendance.  The supervisory authority is of the opinion that biometric data of students was processed which is why Art. 9 GDPR is applicable. Additionally, the authority argued that consent can not be applied since students and their guardians cannot freely decide if they/their children want to be monitored for attendance purposes. When examining if the school board can rely on any of the exemptions listed in Art. 9 (2), the supervisory authority found that this was not the case. The supervisory authority also found that there was a case of a processing activity with high risks since new technology was used to process sensitive personal data concerning children who are in a dependency position to the high school board and due to camera surveillance being used in the students everyday environment. In the view of the authority, the school board was not able to demonstrate compliance with Art. 35 GDPR and that the school board was required to consult the authority in accordance with Art. 36 (1) GDPR.;https://www.datainspektionen.se/globalassets/dokument/beslut/facial-recognition-used-to-monitor-the-attendance-of-students.pdf

According to the data protection authority, personal data of tenants were stored without checking whether storage was permissible or even necessary and it was therefore possible to access personal data of affected tenants which had been stored for years without this data still serving the purpose of its original collection. This involved data on the personal and financial circumstances of tenants, such as salary statements, self-disclosure forms, extracts from employment and training contracts, tax, social security and health insurance data as well as bank statements. In addition to sanctioning this structural violation, the Berlin data protection commissioner imposed further fines of between 6,000 and 17,000 euros on the company for the inadmissible storage of personal data of tenants in 15 specific individual cases.

A caller could obtain extensive information on personal customer data from the company's customer service department simply by entering a customer's name and date of birth. In this authentication procedure, the BfDI aws a violation of Article 32 GDPR, according to which a company is obliged to take appropriate technical and organisational measures to systematically protect the processing of personal data. Due to the company's cooperation with the data protection authority, the fine imposed was at the lower end of the scale. -- Update: On November 11th, 2020, after an appeal against the fine, the Bonn District Court decided that although the fine is justified in principle, it is unreasonably high. The chamber has therefore reduced the fine from originally EUR 9,55 million to EUR 900,000. One of the reasons for the reduction was that the company's procedure for authenticating customers used for its telephone hotline (requesting only the name and date of birth of the caller) had remained unobjected for a long time and therefore the company lacked a concrete awareness of the problem which leads to the fact that the concrete culpability in this case had to be classified as rather low. Furthermore, according to the court, the violation was also rather minor, as it could not lead to a massive data leakage.;https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Pressemitteilungen/2019/30_BfDIverh%C3%A4ngtGeldbu%C3%9Fe1u1.html

Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten had already completed a review in 2017 of the way in which Google deals with the right of individuals to have search results removed from Google's search engine and that Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten had instructed Google to remove a number of search results. In addition, data inspections stated that it had initiated a further review of Google's practices in 2018 after it received indications that several of the results that should have been removed still appeared in search results. Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten also objected to Google's current practice of informing web site owners about which results Google is removing from search results, specifically which link has been removed and who is behind the request for removal from the list, as this is without legal basis.

Update: On November 23th, 2020, after an appeal against the fine, the The Administrative Court of Stockholm announced that it had rejected Google LLCs appeal.
However the court reduced the fine from a total of SEK 75 million (approx. EUR  7 million) to SEK 52 million (approx. EUR 5 million).";https://www.datainspektionen.se/globalassets/dokument/beslut/2020-03-11-beslut-google.pdf

The reasons for the fine were the rejection of an application by a data subject for dereferencing outdated articles that the data subject had considered to be damaging to its reputation, and lack of transparency in Google's form for dereferencing applications. The Belgian data protection authority found that articles relating to unfounded harassment complaints could have serious consequences for the data subjects, and natural persons were therefore entitled to have articles deleted/dereferenced. This also applies to persons who hold political office, even though these offices are generally less worthy of protection due to their public status and articles relating to political persons may therefore be stored for a longer period of time. Google's rejection of the application was therefore in breach of Article 17 of the GDPR (fine for this breach: ?500,000). In addition, a further ?100,000 was imposed for breach of the principle of transparency, as Google's rejection of the request for deletion was not sufficiently justified;https://www.autoriteprotectiondonnees.be/publications/decision-quant-au-fond-n-37-2020.pdf

Here, according to the findings of the Hamburg data protection officer, since at least 2014 private life circumstances of some of the employees have been comprehensively recorded and this information stored on a network drive. For example, the company conducted a 'Welcome Back Talk' after employees returned to work after vacation or illness. The information that became known in this context - including information on the symptoms of illness and diagnoses of the employees - was recorded and stored. In addition, according to the Hamburg data protection authority, some supervisors also used the 'Flurfunk' [meaning to hear something through the grapevine] to acquire a broad knowledge of individual employees, for example about family problems and religious beliefs. The information stored on the network drive was accessible to up to 50 managers of the company and was used, among other things, to evaluate the work performance of the employees and to make employment decisions.The data collection became known due to a technical configuration error in October 2019, according to which the data stored on the network drive was accessible company-wide for several hours. After the violation became known, the management apologized to the employees and offered monetary compensation. In addition, also further protective measures were introduced together with the data protection authority.

During its investigation, the CNIL found that the information on personal data provided to users of the carrefour.fr websites and those wishing to join the loyalty program was neither easily accessible nor easily comprehensible. The CNIL also found that the information regarding the transfer of data to countries outside the EU and regarding the duration of data storage was incomplete.
The CNIL also notes that the company did not comply with the storage time limits.
Furthermore, the data of more than twenty-eight million customers who were inactive for five to ten years were stored for the purposes of the loyalty program. This was also the case for 750,000 users of the carrefour.fr site, who were inactive for five to ten years. 
The CNIL states that the company required proof of identity for almost every user request to exercise a right. However, this automatic requirement was not justified, as in most cases there was no doubt regarding the identity of the data subjects.
Furthermore, the company did not respond to several requests from individuals who wanted to access their personal data. 
Also, in numerous cases, the company did not carry out the erasure of data requested by individuals.

This statement was submitted to the bank online and forwarded to several employees of the bank. One employee photographed the declaration with his cell phone and spread it via WhatsApp. Subsequently, the document was posted on the social network Facebook and on a website. This situation led to the disclosure and unauthorized access of certain personal data concerning four data subjects, despite the Bank's commitment to respect the principle of integrity and confidentiality of personal data as required by Art. 5 (1) f) GDPR. The DPA notes that the occurred disclosure of the data also proves the ineffectiveness of the internal training of the Bank's employees regarding compliance with the standards for data protection.

In May 2020, the DPA received a notification from a third party about a personal data breach involving an insurance agent acting as a processing agent for Towarzystwo Ubezpieczen i Reasekuracji WARTA S.A. who sent an insurance policy to an unauthorized addressee by email. The document contained personal data concerning, among others, surnames, first names, residential addresses and information on the subject of the insurance policy. 
As a result, the supervisory authority asked the controller to clarify whether, regarding the sending of the electronic correspondence to an unauthorized addressee, a risk analysis on the data security of natural persons had been carried out, which is necessary to evaluate whether a data breach had occurred. Such a breach requires notification to the DPA and the individuals affected by the breach. In the letter, the supervisory authority advised the controller how to notify the breach and asked for explanations.
Despite the letter requesting explanations, the controller did not report the data breach nor did it inform the data subjects about the incident. The DPA therefore initiated administrative proceedings. Only as a result of the initiation of the procedure did the controller report the personal data breach and inform two individuals affected by the breach.";https://uodo.gov.pl/decyzje/DKN.5131.5.2020

Among others, the cameras covered workplaces, sales areas, warehouses and recreation areas. The company stated that the purpose of the installed video cameras was to prevent and investigate criminal acts and to track the movement of goods in the warehouses. However, to prevent theft, a company must first consider milder methods. Moreover, video surveillance to detect criminal acts is only permitted if there is a reasonable suspicion against specific persons. If this is the case, it may be permissible to monitor them with cameras for a limited period of time. At notebooksbilliger.de, however, the video surveillance was neither limited to a specific period nor to specific employees. In addition, the recordings were stored for 60 days in many cases, which was significantly longer than required. Customers of notebooksbilliger.de were also affected by the unlawful video surveillance, as some cameras were pointed at seating areas in the sales area.

EUR 6,000,000 for violations of Art. 6 GDPR, Art. 13 GDPR and Art. 14 GDPR.         
Customers of the bank were supposed to accept new privacy policies allowing the controller to transfer the customers' personal data to all companies within the CaixaBank Group. At the same time, the data subjects were not given the option of specifically not consenting to this transfer. Instead, if they wished to disagree with the transfer of their data, they were required to send a letter of disagreement to each individual company in the group.

The DPA concluded that the bank had violated its information obligations as set out in Art. 13 GDPR and Art. 14 GDPR, as the information provided to customers under the privacy policy was not consistent, contained imprecise terminology, and did not provide sufficient information on the type of personal data processed and the nature of the processing.  Also, the information on the rights of the data subjects as well as the contact information of the controller were not provided in a consistent manner. 

Furthermore, the DPA notes that the controller had processed its customers' data beyond its legitimate interests, partly without a legal basis, and that the consent it obtained from customers did not meet the requirements of an effective consent. In addition, deficiencies in the company's procedures allowed it to obtain the consent of customers to process their personal data. The DPA further concludes that, as a result, the data was unlawfully transferred to the companies of the CaixaBank Group.

The municipality of Rome had been using the 'TuPassi' booking system to manage appointments and other services since 2015. In the course of a detailed investigation, the Italian DPA found that the controller had violated several data protection regulations with regard to the processing of personal data of customers and employees with whom they had made appointments. For example, the municipality had not properly informed the data subjects prior to processing their data, nor had it taken appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the processing.;https://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9524175

When he was no longer able to use the mobile data, he contacted the controller. The controller informed him that the mobile data had been deactivated because the number was no longer in his possession. It turned out that unauthorized third parties had pretended to be the data subject and had the number transferred to a third party without the controller requiring authentication for this. Thereupon the unauthorized third parties had requested and received a replacement SIM card under the pretense of an alleged loss or theft. As a result, the son's SIM card was blocked.;https://www.aepd.es/es/documento/ps-00235-2020.pdf

The Italian DPA notes several violations of data protection provisions related to this program. 
For example, when giving consent to the processing of their data, the data subjects were not adequately informed about how long their data would be stored, what rights they had (in particular their rights of complaint and access), and how exactly their data would be processed and for what purpose. In addition, the controller had not kept a register of processing activities. Finally, the controller had neither implemented adequate technical and organizational measures to protect the processing nor conducted a data protection impact assessment, although this would have been necessary due to the nature of the data processed (health data).";https://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9529527

The recording was ultimately made available on social media and in the media. The DPA found that the security company as a data processor enabled the breach by not maintaining adequate and sufficient technical and organizational measures for personal data security for more than two and a half years. Moreover, the processor has not foreseen or implemented adequate technical security measures following the incident to prevent or minimize the risks. One data subject was consequently exposed to insults and ridicule in the public and the security company has not taken any action to remove the recording from social networks and media. The amount of the fine is NA at the moment, but the DPA clarified which aggravating circumstances it has taken into consideration when determining the fine ? (i) the fact that the processor did not fulfil its obligation to inform the controller of the incident as required by the Art 33 (2) GDPR and (ii) the fact that the basic activity of the company is the provision of physical and technical protection, which includes the use of video surveillance. The DPA also noted that the fined security company is one of the leading companies in Croatia in that activity and as such should be the relevant entity in providing opinions, guidelines, advice and propose solutions to controllers on the use of the video surveillance system and give an example to its work and pay greater attention to it than others.;https://azop.hr/izdana-nova-upravna-novcana-kazna/

During that investigation, the DPA identified several violations. 

The controller had collected data on tens of thousands of politicians from public sources and cross-checked it with data from applicants. In doing so, however, the controller had failed to ensure that data was collected only from those politicians who were eligible to receive the assistance funds. In doing so, the controller violated the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency as set out in the GDPR.

Furthermore, the controller had violated the principle of data minimization by initiating checks on reimbursements even for individuals whose applications had been rejected and who had therefore never received payments.

Furthermore, the controller had not adequately assessed the risks associated with a data processing operation as sensitive as that on applications for social benefits, since it had not carried out an impact assessment on the rights and freedoms of the data subjects.";https://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9556958

The second complaint was filed by the data subject because the controller repeatedly sent him messages containing confidential data of a third party.

The data subjects complained about advertising calls and messages (e-mail and SMS) made on behalf of Vodafone Espana as part of marketing campaigns. The contact was made without the prior consent of the data subjects and continued even after they had exercised their right to object. Furthermore, many data subjects were contacted even though their numbers were on the Robinson list.

The AEPD explains that aggravatingly, it took into account that Vodafone Espana had regularly received fines in more than 50 cases from January 2018 to February 2020, and the fact that there had been 162 complaints received by the AEPD in just under two years.

The controller then approved the loan. Since the data processed in the course of granting the loan did not belong to the loan recipient, but to the data subject, the AEPD determined that the controller did not have a legal basis for processing the data. The processing was therefore unlawful, and a breach of Art. 6 (1) GDPR was affirmed.

After her address had changed in 2018, in 2019 she received mail from the controller to her new address without having informed the controller of the adress change. In the letter, the controller informed the data subject that her driver's license would soon expire. In response to a inquiry from the data subject as to where her new contact information came from, the controller informed her that its database was regularly updated using data obtained from the Spanish transport authority DGT (Direccion General de Trafico). As the data subject had not given consent for such processing of her data, she filed a complaint against the controller with the Spanish DPA. An investigation by the DPA revealed that the company had indeed entered into a contract with DGT. However, DGT had clarified that the purpose of the processing of contact data under the contract was to ensure the accuracy of the address when renewing a driver's license or when issuing medical reports so that it could be sent to the correct address. Nevertheless, the data subjects must request and consequently consent to such a change of address.

In Italy, small and medium-sized companies that had previously received a relevant voucher could book advice on technological and digital processes from experienced business professionals, through the controller. The Italian DPA launched an investigation against the controller after it became known that personal data of more than five thousand managers who had made themselves available for corresponding consultations were freely accessible on its website. The personal data, such as name, tax number, e-mail, full CV and in some cases a copy of the identity card and health card of the data subjects, was publicly visible and could be freely downloaded.  On the website, it was also possible to download the directorate resolution that had approved the list, which included the data and information of all the directors. The DPA found that the processing was unlawful and that the directorate resolution referred to by the controller did not constitute an adequate legal basis for the disclosure of online data.";https://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9556625

At two schools in Alesund, teachers asked students to download the training app Strava for physical education classes. The students were then given tasks that the teachers controlled via the tracking function. According to the Norwegian DPA's investigation, this resulted in data breaches because the municipality failed to provide standard procedures for privacy-compliant app use in schools. For example, a data protection impact assessment was not carried out, although this would have been necessary in view of the potential risk to the students. In addition, adequate technical and organizational security measures had not been implemented to ensure the protection of the processing.;https://www.datatilsynet.no/aktuelt/aktuelle-nyheter-2021/gebyr-til-alesund-kommune-for-bruk-av-strava/

The latter had installed a webcam on the roof of its office building in the center of Rognan which was in operation 24/7 and recorded the city center. These recordings could be viewed via a live video stream on Youtube and on the controller's homepage. In addition, the recordings could be rewound for up to twelve hours. 

The area covered by the camera surveillance included a public street, the parking lot and entrance of two grocery stores, a pharmacy, a liquor store, the local bank, city hall, and a number of other buildings.

It was not possible to make out facial details or read license plates on cars due to the image quality and distance from the camera. Nevertheless, the image quality was good enough to be able to identify what type of car the data subjects were driving, what type of clothing they were wearing, what hair color they had, and other personal characteristics. This was sufficient for those watching the live broadcast to identify and track co-workers, colleagues, friends, family, or other acquaintances.

The Norwegian DPA concluded that the live broadcast constitutes a breach of Art. 6 (1) GDPR and Art. 5 (1) a) GPDR.

The decision highlights that the illegal camera surveillance involved a significant number of employees and that many were monitored repeatedly, some on a daily basis. Those who were monitored were on their way to and from work, who needed to buy groceries, medications, or alcohol, or who were in the public area for other reasons. These are activities where the data subjects do not expect to be monitored, and even less they expect the monitoring to be broadcast live on the Internet.";https://www.datatilsynet.no/aktuelt/aktuelle-nyheter-2021/dragefossen-as-far-gebyr/

In December 2018, criminals gained access to the data of 4,109 people who had booked a hotel room through the booking site. That included their names, addresses and phone numbers, as well as details about their booking. The criminals also accessed the credit card data of 283 people and managed to access the credit card's security code in 97 cases. Furthermore, they tried to get other victims' credit card details by pretending to be Booking.com employees via email or phone. Booking.com was notified of the data breach on January 13, 2019, but did not report it to the DPA until February 7, 2019.

Following a complex preliminary investigation launched after hundreds of reports and complaints from users, the DPA finds that the controller illegally processed the personal data of millions of users for telemarketing purposes.

Namely, the call centers working for Fastweb largely acted in disregard of data protection regulations. They often used telephone numbers for their calls that were not registered in the Italian register for communications operators (Registro degli Operatori di Comunicazione). 
Moreover, they processed contact data for promotions Fastweb had received from external partners without the data subjects having given valid consent for their data to be shared. 

In addition, many users reported being contacted by 'self-proclaimed Fastweb operators' who attempted to obtain contractors' identity documents via WhatsApp, likely for the purpose of spamming, phishing and other fraudulent activities.

Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi had notified the DPA of a data breach under Art. 33 GDPR regarding the transfer of health data to the wrong person. Medical documents of a patient had been sent by mail both to the affected patient and to another patient. The controller states that the incident occurred due to an error in the printing process. The ward where the affected patient was treated was only equipped with two printers, and one doctor had unknowingly also taken a colleague's print job (the affected patient's documents) when taking out his print job (the documents of the wrong recipient).;https://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9574789

Following a complaint from a former customer, claiming that the bank did not comply with his request to erasure of his data, the DPA started an investigation against the controller. The data subject had already been a customer of the bank in the past. At that time, he had exercised his right to erasure of his data. When he tried to open a new account with the controller, he was informed that this was not possible as his data was still blocked (due to his previous erasure request). The controller further informed the data subject that he would have to unblock the data if he wanted to open an account. For this purpose, a form was attached to the letter. The form stated that by signing it, the data subject was revoking his right to erasure and allowing his data to be used (again) by the controller. The DPA found that temporarily blocking the data, does not correspond to the right to erasure. The DPA also emphasized that deleted or blocked data may not be processed again when a new contractual relationship is entered into with the controller, even if the new processing purpose is the same as the previous one. The original fine of EUR 100,000 was reduced to EUR 60,000 euros due to the immediate payment and acknowledgement of guilt.;https://www.aepd.es/es/documento/ps-00473-2020.pdf

Due to the high value of the sports equipment, the controller required a financial deposit or a full copy of a valid ID when renting sports equipment. The consent to the copy of the ID was included in the sports equipment rental agreement itself. Thus, when the sports equipment rental agreement was signed, consent to the processing of the ID copy was obtained at the same time. The DPA considered this method of obtaining consent to be a violation against the lawfulness of the processing. In addition, it was found that the data subjects were not properly informed about the processing of their personal data.;https://www.uoou.cz/kontrola-zpracovani-osobnich-udaju-prostrednictvim-kopii-obcanskych-prukazu/ds-6267/archiv=1&p1=5649

Moreover, there were no outstanding invoices, as the amount to be paid was always zero euros. The data subjects had asked the controller several times to stop sending them text messages and to delete their data. The controller had explained that the messages had been sent due to a technical error and assured the data subjects that they would no longer receive such notifications in the future.

In 2017, the municipality decided to install special measurement boxes to measure crowds in the city center of Enschede. Sensors in the measurement boxes detected the wifi signals from the cell phones of passers-by and registered them with a code. Based on the registered codes, it was possible to calculate how busy the city center was. However, this also made it possible to track which measurement box a particular cell phone passed by, making it possible to track the movement of passers-by. The municipality states that it was never its intention to track passers-by. However, the DPA finds that the wifi tracking (even if it was unintentional) constitutes a serious breach of the GDPR. The DPA concludes that the municipality tracked its passers-by without an effective legal basis and thus violated Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR and Art. 6 (1) GDPR.;https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/sites/default/files/atoms/files/boetebesluit_ap_gemeente_enschede.pdf

A number of people had been issued parking tickets by the controller and had thereupon requested information about which personal data was being processed and, in some cases, requested the deletion of their data. However, in order to process the requests, the controller stated that it needed the ID card number and address of the data subjects for identification purposes, as their name with the parking ticket number was not sufficient to verify their identity. According to the DPA, the controller has not only violated its duty to inform the data subjects and the right to delete their data, but has also violated the principle of data minimization. The DPA stressed that it is permitted to request further proof of identification if there are reasonable doubts about the identity of the data subject. However, in the cases in question, no such doubts had existed. Furthermore, the DPA found a violation of the principle of storage limitation. The controller had stored photos of incorrectly parked cars and copies of parking tickets for possible future disputes in court without having defined a deadline for the deletion of the data.;https://tietosuoja.fi/documents/6927448/58640544/Seuraamuskollegion+p%C3%A4%C3%A4t%C3%B6s_henkil%C3%B6tietojen+k%C3%A4sittely+pys%C3%A4k%C3%B6inninvalvontamaksujen+yhteydess%C3%A4.pdf/9b105604-51e0-7beb-e21b-df1b504843e6/Seuraamuskollegion+p%C3%A4%C3%A4t%C3%B6s_henkil%C3%B6tietojen+k%C3%A4sittely+pys%C3%A4k%C3%B6inninvalvontamaksujen+yhteydess%C3%A4.pdf?t=1619763172841

Furthermore, the DPA found that the controller had not implemented adequate technical and organizational measures to protect the processing when recording absences. Namely, the absence registration was accessible online, without any form of authentication. Yet, when an absence system is accessible via the Internet, the system is to be accessed only through a multi-factor authentication.

According to Vodafone's commissioned processor, the advertising call to the data subject had occurred due to an error in the call number filtering system. In the course of its investigation, the DPA found that Vodafone had not established any measures to avoid advertising calls to numbers on the Robinson list. In the present case, Vodafone had not even been aware that the number of the data subject was on the Robinson list, which meant that it was not blocked for the commissioned company.;https://www.aepd.es/es/documento/ps-00030-2021.pdf

The fine consists of EUR 20,000 due to a violation of Art. 5 (1) c) GDPR and EUR 6,000 due to a violation of Art. 12 GDPR. The fine was based on the fact that the controller installed a video surveillance system totaling 14 video cameras and monitoring the business premises. The controller states that the cameras were installed for the purpose of security of the premises. However, the cameras captured the employees' offices in a way that was not necessary for this purpose. For example, one camera also captured a considerable part of the employees' recreation room.

The DPA's review found that the consent given by customers to have their fingerprint patterns processed was not voluntary as there were no other identification measures. In addition, the DPA found that the controller also unlawfully processed employees' fingerprints. The controller also failed to set out for what purpose and on what legal basis it processed the employees' biometric data.

The controller had equipped ticket inspectors with body-worn cameras, which were designed to prevent threatening situations, document incidents, and ensure that the right person was fined for traveling on Stockholm's public transportation without a valid ticket.
Ticket inspectors were required to keep the camera on for their entire shift and were therefore able to film all passengers who passed the inspector. Since several hundred thousand people use public transportation in Stockholm every day, a large number of people were thus at risk of being monitored by video and audio recordings.

The DPA believes that body-worn camera technology could be used to prevent and document threatening situations, but that the pre-recording time should be reduced to a maximum of 15 seconds, as a longer pre-recording time is not necessary to achieve the above-mentioned purposes. Furthermore the DPA found that audio recordings did not contribute to the identification of persons without a valid ticket. The DPA therefore considered the audio recordings to be a violation of the principles of legality and transparency as well as data minimization. The DPA also criticized the controller for not providing sufficient information about the camera surveillance, including the fact that not only images but also sounds were recorded.";https://www.imy.se/globalassets/dokument/beslut/2021/2021-06-21-beslut-sl.pdf

EUR 2,856,169 for failing to verify that all transfers of data of recipients of promotional activities were covered by consent. Several data subjects filed complaints with the DPA against the controller because they had received unsolicited advertising to which they had never consented. In its investigation against the cotroller, the DPA found that the cotroller had in fact processed personal data for telemarketing activities that it had not collected directly but had acquired from other sources. It had not checked whether valid consents had been obtained from the advertising addressees for all transfers of the data. The controller had received lists of personal data from one company, which in turn had acquired them from two other companies. The latter companies had obtained the consent of potential customers for the telemarketing carried out by them and by third parties, but this consent did not include the transfer of customer data to the controller. In this context, the DPA emphasized that consent given by a customer to a company for third-party promotional activities cannot extend its effectiveness to subsequent transfers to other operators.;https://www.gpdp.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9670025

In January, the municipality of Rygge was annexed to the municipality of Moss. For this reason, several IT systems from both municipalities were combined. 
Due to inadequate security measures, a data breach occurred in a productive system used in the municipality's health service. 
This system processed personal and health data and affected people who live in the municipality and use the health center. The system is used for services related to immunization programs in the municipality, as well as for other health checks and follow-ups of pregnant women. About 2000 people were potentially affected by the breach. Due to the data breach, errors had occurred in vaccine registration. As a result, the data subjects were at risk of receiving the wrong vaccines. There was also a potential for their immunization data to be misfiled in the national immunization registry.
Furthermore, errors occurred in follow-ups for pregnant women, including information on the week of pregnancy or the mother's drug use. 
Also, patient information was provided to health workers in a health service ward without being required and without access being documented.";https://www.datatilsynet.no/contentassets/e7e029cdedec4c4e8907aef6bb08590c/20_02165-9-vedtak-om-overtredelsesgebyr--moss-kommune-236334_9_1.pdf

A former employee filed a complaint against the controller with the DPA. The reason for this was the camera surveillance installed by the controller. During their shifts, the controller's employees wore clothing provided by the controller.However, the designated changing room of the store was a storage room in which large quantities of cleaning materials were stored.  Due to a lack of sufficient space in this room, the employees (mostly minors) had to change in the general employee area, which was covered by a video camera. The controller stated that they had installed the video camera for security purposes. The DPA concluded that the controller had a legitimate interest in the video surveillance, but that the interests of the mostly underage employees must also be taken in account. The controller should have tried to implement less restrictive measures. In addition, the DPA underlined that the information on video surveillance was inadequate in both the employee and customer service areas. In determining the amount of the fine, the fact that a large number of the data subjects were minors was taken into account as an aggravating factor.;https://www.personuvernd.is/urlausnir/huppuis-ehf.-sektud-vegna-voktunar-med-eftirlitsmyndavelum-i-starfsmannarymi-1

In the process, the DPA found some serious violations of applicable data protection regulations. Thus, the DPA identified some irregularities concerning the algorithms of the Foodinho system. In particular, the DPA found that the controller had not adequately informed employees about how the system worked and did not guarantee the accuracy and correctness of the results of the algorithms used to evaluate drivers. Furthermore, the DPA found violations of the principles of data minimization as well as memory limitation. For example, the systems processed drivers' data to an extent that exceeded the purpose of the processing and, in some cases, stored the data significantly longer than necessary. In addition, the controller had not taken sufficient technical and organizational measures to ensure secure data processing. The controller had also not conducted a data protection impact assessment, although this would have been necessary due to the considerable amount of data of different types relating to a significant number of data subjects.

The DPA received four complaints against the magazine publisher for unsolicited telephone advertising.The controller had carried out direct marketing using an automated calling system, without valid consent from the recipients of the calls.
Specifically, the controller had obtained the apparent consent for direct marketing when a customer subscribed to a magazine on its website, for example.  The subscriber to the magazine was required to accept the terms of the subscription and contract, which included consent to direct marketing. If the consent to direct marketing was not given, the magazine could not be subscribed. The DPA states that the consent and the way it was obtained did not comply with the GDPR. Indeed, the consent was not specifically requested for direct marketing and the consent collected together with the subscription and contract terms did not constitute voluntary consent for the purpose of direct marketing. 

In addition, it was not possible for data subjects to exercise their right to object due to the fact that the direct marketing calls were made using automated calling systems and the voice bots could not understand specific questions from data subjects about their data. 

Furthermore, the magazine publisher had commissioned a call center to carry out the advertising campaign and had not regulated its processing activities in a contract on commissioned processing.";https://finlex.fi/fi/viranomaiset/tsv/2021/20210863

The data controller, a telecommunications company using the services of the IT provider, informed the DPA as well its users of the potential breach of personal data by the IT provider. The incident consisted of a security breach which led to unauthorized access and processing of personal data by hackers and involved personal data of 28,085 respondents. The incident occurred because the IT provider had not taken the necessary measures to achieve an adequate level of security in accordance with existing and foreseeable risks. The IT provider, as a data processor, was obliged to take appropriate technical security measures in such a way as to ensure the permanent confidentiality of the system, including regular testing, evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures to ensure security of processing. When assessing the appropriate level of security, the IT provider should have taken particular account of the risks of unauthorized disclosure of personal data. Due to failure to take appropriate technical measures for the security of personal data processing, the DPA imposed an administrative fine on the IT provider. The amount of the fine is NA at the moment. In its decision, the DPA took into account the nature of the IT provider?s business activity, whose role should be to support other entities through opinions and guidelines, proposing solutions for the implementation of web applications, and especially designing and implementing appropriate technical measures.;https://azop.hr/izdane-nove-upravne-novcane-kazne/

The controller had emailed two of the company's customers informing them that the former employee had committed crimes in the course of employment and had admitted to committing them, as well as describing in detail the alleged course of events. 

According to the DPA, the controller in such a case had a 
legitimate interest in disclosing information about the former employee's dismissal to its customers and in informing the customers that, as a result, the employee could not enter into any contracts on behalf of the company.

A former employee of the municipality filed a complaint with the DPA against the municipality. 
In particular, the former employee complained that the municipality processed personal data related to his internet use during working hours and that he later received a notice of initiation of disciplinary proceedings accusing him of accessing Facebook for more than 40 minutes and YouTube for more than 3 hours during his working hours and of using the municipality's computer for private purposes.  The DPA's investigation revealed that the municipality had been using a system to control and filter employees' internet browsing for about a decade, with monthly retention of data and creation of special reports for network security purposes. The system also collected information that had nothing to do with professional activities and, in any case, concerned the private life of the person in question.
The DPA finds that the controller thus violated the principle of data minimization, lawfulness and purpose limitation. The controller should rather have taken less intrusive measures to prevent the private use of the Internet. The DPA pointed out that the need to reduce the risk of misuse of Internet navigation cannot lead to the complete elimination of any privacy of the data subject at the workplace, even in cases where the employee uses network services provided by the employer. In addition, the controller had not adequately informed employees about the collection of Internet history, in violation of its obligation under Article 13 of the GDPR. 
Furthermore, the investigation identified other violations in the processing of data related to employees' requests for extraordinary medical examinations, which were made using a special form. The form provided by the controller had to be checked by the head of the organizational unit, a circumstance that led to the unlawful processing of health data.";https://www.garanteprivacy.it/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9669974

In May 2019, several media revealed that MONSANTO was in possession of a file containing the personal data of more than 200 political figures or members of civil society (e.g. journalists, environmental activists, scientists or farmers) likely to influence the debate or public opinion on the renewal of the authorization of glyphosate in Europe. At the same time, the CNIL received seven complaints from data subjects affected by this file.

For each of these individuals, the file contained information such as the organization they belonged to, the position they held, their business address, their business phone number, their cell phone number, their business email address, and in some cases their Twitter account. In addition, CNIL noted that each person was assigned a score from 1 to 5 to evaluate their influence, credibility, and support for Monsanto on various issues.

The DPA believes that the company violated the provisions of the GDPR by not informing the data subjects that their data was stored in this file. In addition, the CNIL complained that the company had not given the contractual guarantees that should normally regulate the relationship with a subcontractor. 

The creation of contact files by stakeholders for lobbying purposes is not illegal in itself. However, CNIL stressed that data subjects nevertheless have the right to be informed of the existence of the file in order to exercise additional rights, in particular the right to object. 

In addition, the CNIL found that the data collection was carried out by a provider contracted by Monsanto and that Monsanto violated Article 28 of the General Data Protection Regulation by not including in its contracts with the data processor the provisions foreseen in the GDPR, in particular regarding data security.";https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/cnil/id/CNILTEXT000043860997https://www.cnil.fr/fr/fichier-de-lobbying-sanction-de-400-000-euros-lencontre-de-la-societe-monsanto

EUR 2,520,000. The controller had installed facial recognition systems in Mercadona stores for the purpose of tracking individuals with criminal convictions or restraining orders. The system captured everyone who entered the stores, including minors and MERCADONA employees.
During its investigation, the DPA found numerous privacy violations. 

For instance, the system violated the principle of data minimization, the principle of necessity and proportionality since the controller could process multiple biometric data - beyond the purpose of the system. 

In addition, the DPA concluded that Mercadona's privacy impact assessment was deficient as it did not take into account the specific and unique risks to Mercadona's employees posed by data processing through facial recognition systems.

Furthermore, MERCADONA had violated its duty to inform according by not properly providing data subjects with information about the processing of their personal data.

The original fine of EUR 3,150,000 consisted of EUR 500,000 due to a violation of Art. 5(1)(c), EUR 2,000,000 due to a violation of Art. 6 and Art. 9 of the GDPR, EUR 100,000 due to a violation of Art. 12 and Art. 13 of the GDPR, EUR 500,000 due to a violation of Art. 25(1) of the GDPR, and EUR 50,000 due to a violation of Art. 35 of the GDPR.

The controller had introduced a mobile application that allowed teleworkers to clock in and out. The use of the application on a mobile device also required authorization for location data collection. The collection of location data at the time of clocking in was a feature of the app, without which it was not possible to clock in working hours using the app.
 
According to the information received from the controller, the controller did not actively use or exploit the location data in any situation, but only processed the location data at the time of clocking in for technical reasons. However, the mere fact that time clocking is not possible in the application without processing the location data does not make it necessary to process them.
The DPA therefore considered this to be a violation of the lawfulness of the data collection and of the principle of data minimization, since the processing of location data was not necessary for the purpose of the processing - i.e., the mere recording of working hours.";https://tietosuoja.fi/-/korkeakoululle-seuraamusmaksu-tietosuojarikkomuksista-tyoajanseurannassa-kertyneiden-sijaintitietojen-kasittelyssa

EUR 2,500,000 for unlawfully processing the personal data of approximately 8000 drivers. Garante's investigation revealed numerous and serious data protection violations.
The violations included a lack of transparency in the algorithms used to manage drivers, both when assigning jobs and when booking work shifts.
Deliveroo had used a centralized system for driver management through which it then processed and managed the assignment of orders as well as the booking of work shifts.
However, Garante notes that the controller did not adequately inform the drivers about the functioning of the system they had installed on their smartphones, and did not ensure the accuracy and correctness of the results of the algorithmic systems used to evaluate the drivers. 
In addition, Garante found that Deliveroo carried out a meticulous control of the drivers' work performance - through the continuous geolocation of their device, which went far beyond what was necessary to assign the order (e.g., recording the position every 12 seconds) - and through the storage of a large amount of personal data collected during the execution of the orders, including communication with customer service. In this context, the storage period of the various data had not been defined in a manner appropriate to the purpose. Instead, the controller had defined a flat storage period of six years. Furthermore, the Garante found that the controller had not implemented adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure adequate security of the processing. Deliveroo Italy had also not conducted a data protection impact assessment, although this would have been necessary due to the risk posed to the drivers.";https://www.gpdp.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9685994

According to the GDPR, the clarification must be easily accessible and in simple language. However, the controller had designed the registration for the jo Bonus Club in such a way that the clarification about profiling could only be found after scrolling down. However, the consent was placed higher up, so in all cases the consents were obtained before the clarification. In turn, on the physical flyers, the signature box placed at the bottom of the form appeared as if it were a confirmation of enrollment in the club, even though it constituted consent to profiling as well.

The DPA had started extensive investigations into the messaging service's compliance with transparency obligations back in December 2018. In this context, the DPC investigated whether WhatsApp complied with its obligations under the GDPR regarding the provision of information and the transparency of this information to users and non-users of WhatsApp. 

In the course of the investigation, the DPC found that WhatsApp had committed serious violations of Art. 12 GDPR, Art. 13 GDPR and Art. 14 GDPR with respect to the information provided to users. 

Following the investigation, the DPC submitted a draft decision under Art. 60 GDPR to other affected European supervisory authorities in December 2020. The DPC subsequently received objections from eight supervisory authorities. Due to lack of agreement, the DPC initiated a dispute resolution procedure pursuant to Art. 65 GDPR on June 3, 2021. 

The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPB), by its decision of July 28, 2021, then, required the DPC to reassess and increase its proposed fine based on a number of factors. The EDPS found a violation of the principle of transparency set forth in Article 5(1) a) of the GDPR in addition to the violations found by the DPC, and requested this to be reflected in the final amount of the fine. 

Based on this, the DPC imposed the fine in the amount of EUR 225,000,000. 

The fine is composed as follows:

EUR 90,000,000 for the violation of Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR;
EUR 30,000,000 for the violation of Art. 12 GDPR;
EUR 30,000,000 for the violation of Art. 13 GDPR; and
EUR 75,000,000 for the violation of Art. 14 GDPR.


With respect to Art. 12 GDPR and Art. 13 GDPR, the DPC found that WhatsApp had failed to provide information about the nature of the data collection 'in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.' This includes making the information easy for children to understand when it is addressed to them. For example, WhatsApp had distributed information about the relationship between WhatsApp and other Facebook companies and the sharing of data under that relationship through a variety of texts. Much of the information provided was of such general nature, moreover, that the DPC deemed it meaningless. Users often had to overcome multiple links to FAQs to get to the information they were looking for on WhatsApp's website. In this regard, the DPC stated that it would be unreasonable to expect users to search the WhatsApp website after failing to find sufficient information in the privacy statement itself.

With regard to Art. 14 GDPR, one of the issues was the impact of a user's consent allowing the messaging platform to have access to his or her contacts. As such, the company searched its users' contact information on their phones for phone numbers and other data, not only from other WhatsApp users, but also from contacts who do not even have a WhatsApp account. The DPC finds that this data had been processed unlawfully, as these contacts (especially those who do not have a WhatsApp account) had not received any information about this processing and therefore could not possibly have given their consent. 

Given the seriousness and the far-reaching nature and impact of the breaches, the DPA concluded that there had also been a violation of the transparency principle from Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR.";https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2021-09/dpc_final_decision_redacted_for_issue_to_edpb_01-09-21_en.pdf

The AEPD had received a complaint from the Berlin DPA via the EU Internal Market Information System about the inadequate design of the controller's privacy notice. 
Namely, the identity and contact details of the controller were provided in the privacy notice, but under a misleading heading that gave the impression that they were provided for a business purpose. In addition, the purposes of the processing were not clearly stated. 
No information was provided regarding the legal basis, the retention period of the personal data and the data subjects' right to object. Also, the privacy notice was confusing and the wording contained grammatical errors and used terms that are not part of common usage.

In addition, the privacy notice required a tax identification number in order to issue a simplified invoice, i.e., an invoice not exceeding the amount of EUR 3,000. The AEPD found this to be a violation of the principle of legality. 

The fine is composed as follows:

EUR 3,000 for a breach of Art. 12 GDPR and Art. 13 GDPR;
EUR 1,000 for a breach of Art. 21 (4) GDPR; and

On June 12, 2020, the DPA received a notification from the region regarding a personal data security breach pursuant to Art. 33 GDPR. According to the notification, all patients and staff at a lifestyle center were able to access a building where up to 100,000 physical patient records were stored, including health information and personal identity number details. The reason for this was that both staff and patients had been given key cards that allowed them to access all three buildings of the lifestyle center, regardless of whether the user was required to access them. 
In addition, passersby were able to take a look at the covers of some of the records -which showed personal data such as identity numbers and names - through a window in the building.
In this context, the DPA found that the Midtjylland Region had not taken adequate security measures for the storage of personal data.

In addition, the region had not established sufficient guidelines for access restrictions when creating key cards, and had not conducted adequate periodic testing, assessment, and evaluation of the security measures taken. 

In evaluating the question of whether a fine should be imposed, the Danish DPA took into account, as an aggravating factor, that the region processed large amounts of sensitive data, such as health data.";https://www.datatilsynet.dk/presse-og-nyheder/nyhedsarkiv/2021/sep/region-midtjylland-indstillet-til-boede

The Garante had launched an investigation following a complaint from an individual who had complained about the new parking meters installed in the city in 2018. In fact, the company Atac s.p.a., which was also contracted by the city to manage the parking lots, had initiated a technical upgrade of the parking meters in order to offer new services (e.g., the payment of fines/fees or the purchase/renewal of public transport tickets) and introduce new payment methods that also take into account the vehicle's license plate number. Part of the equipment was supplied by another company, Flowbird Italia s.r.l. All parking information was then managed through a centralized system, which could also be accessed through an app by the employees responsible for controlling parking fees.

Irregularities were then identified during the investigation. Namely, the city of Rome, as data controller, had not provided information on the processing of the drivers' data, had not designated the company Atac as data processor, and had not provided it with the necessary instructions to process the data collected. Also, the subcontractor was not formally instructed nor instructed on how to proceed with the data processing.

It was also found that the companies had not established a data processing register. Also, the retention periods for the collected data were not specified, and appropriate security measures were not taken. For example, it was found that at the time of the audit, some data flows to and from the system implemented by Atac were going through insecure channels. In addition, officials could have checked any license plate en masse and repeatedly over time, for example, to find out a person's habits and parking location. 


In calculating the fine for the unlawful data processing, the DPA aggravatingly took into account the large amount of personal data processed (from June 2018 to November 2019, the system established by Atac had already collected the data of 8,600,000 stops and potentially affects all users of the paid parking service in the city area) and the sanctions already received for data protection violations, but also the positive cooperation offered by the city and the companies to remedy some violations detected during the inspection.";https://www.gpdp.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9698558,

In reviewing the case, the DPO found that Favrskov Municipality had not ensured the encryption of the hard drives of the municipality's laptops for a long period of time prior to August 12, 2020, resulting in an inadequate level of security.

The DPA considered this to be a violation of Art. 32 GDPR, as the municipality had failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of protection commensurate with the risk.";https://www.datatilsynet.dk/presse-og-nyheder/nyhedsarkiv/2021/sep/favrskov-kommune-indstilles-til-boede-

The main activity of Frigorifica Botana is freezing, storing and processing seafood. Based on a complaint against the controller, the AEPD had initiated investigations against it. The controller had installed a video surveillance system (audio and video) that captured, among other things, parts of a conference room. In this context, the DPA found that the controller had violated the principle of data minimization by processing data without a valid reason and without informing the data subjects about the video surveillance in advance.;https://www.aepd.es/es/documento/ps-00093-2021.pdf

On March 9, 2020, the DPA received a notification from Syddanmark Region regarding a personal data breach according to Art. 33 GDPR. The Syddanmark Region states that since May 2011, a PowerPoint presentation was available on its website that had been created at Odense University Hospital for training purposes and contained charts with personal data - including health information and ID card number details - of 3,915 patients. 
The region used a screening tool to periodically check for inadvertent postings of personal identity numbers on its website. However, the screening tool was unable to scan the underlying data in PowerPoint presentations.
In this context, the DPA found that the region had not implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk. 
In assessing whether a fine should be imposed, the DPA took into aggravating consideration the fact that Syddanmark Region processes large amounts of personal data, including health data - which is of a sensitive nature.";https://www.datatilsynet.dk/presse-og-nyheder/nyhedsarkiv/2021/sep/region-syddanmark-indstillet-til-boede

Against this background, he had asked the controller to send him, for his defense in the criminal proceedings, a copy of the video recordings recorded by the bus's video surveillance system on the day on which the incident in question allegedly occurred. However, the controller had never responded to his request. 
The DPA considered this to be a violation of the data subject's right to information pursuant to Art. 12 (3) GDPR and Art. 15 GDPR.

Furthermore, the controller had provided the data subject with a certificate about his previous employment, which, in addition to the type and duration of employment, also contained the information that he had been dismissed due to a criminal offense.

The data subject filed a complaint with the AEPD. He had requested an MRI scan of his knee due to an accident at work. In addition, he had contacted his insurance company in order to obtain a sick leave. The insurance company then contacted the controller, who transmitted the data subject's medical records. In doing so, the controller also provided the insurer with the report of a previous MRI scan of the knee that the data subject had undergone due to an event outside of work. In its evaluation, the insurer thus also referred to the MRI report outside working hours and attributed the data subject's incapacity to work to this event. In consequence, no sick leave was granted to the data subject. The DPA considered the disclosure of the earlier MRI report to the insurance company to be a violation of the principle of integrity and confidentiality.

The fine is related to data matching, which the controller had carried out in the period from August 2018 to December 2019 in the course of contract inquiries for special contracts. The special contracts served to attract new customers and were accompanied by bonus payments for the customers. The controller compared personal data of prospective customers who had submitted an inquiry for a special contract with contracts concluded by existing customers. If this revealed that an applicant had already signed a contract with the controller, then switched to another supplier and now wanted to sign a contract again, the controller could reject the application for the special contract if necessary. This was intended to prevent 'bonus shopping', which is not lucrative for the companies. However, the controller had not properly informed the customers that such comparisons would be made. The DPA considered this to be a violation of the company's transparency and information obligations.

Through a report on the state-owned broadcasting company NRK, the Norwegian DPA became aware that Ferde AS was transferring information on passages in toll rings to a data processor in China. On this basis, the DPA initiated an investigation into whether Ferde has implemented routines and measures to ensure adequate information security for the information transferred to China.

As part of its operations, Ferde is responsible for registering passages at toll booths. The registration is usually done by a chip in the car. If the chip in the car is not properly registered or the car does not have a chip, a photo of the car's license plate is taken.

These images are then sent to an automatic optical character recognition system to digitally read the license plate. In cases where the image quality is not good enough for automatic interpretation, the image is transmitted for manual processing. Ferde contracted Unitel Bratseth Services (UBS), which also has employees in China, for this task. 

After its investigations, the DPA concluded that Ferde AS had violated a number of basic obligations of the GDPR for a period of 1-2 years. 

For one thing, Ferde had not conducted a risk assessment before processing personal data and before using manual image processing by the processor. However, this would have been necessary to assess the risks associated with the transfer and to determine whether further security measures may be required. 

In addition, the DPA found that Ferde had not entered into a proper processor contract regarding the processing of UBS.As a result, the transfer of the personal data in question to China took place without a valid legal basis. 
In determining the amount of the fine, the DPA took into account the aggravating factor that a large amount of personal data was affected by the violation. On the other hand, the fact that no material or immaterial damage to the affected parties could be proven had a mitigating effect.";https://www.datatilsynet.no/contentassets/7121f4f2de614186bc535823c9da7102/20_01727-3vedtak-om-overtredelsesgebyr---ferde-as.pdf

She then requested that her phone number be deleted from the company database.

The controller had obtained the information regarding the data subject's ownership of the property from an openly accessible public register. At no time had the data subject consented to such a contact request. The controller had argued during the DPA's investigation that consent for others to contact her could be inferred from the fact that she had a public profile. However, the DPA noted that the exchange of information via a social network should only allow for what is specified in the relevant terms of use. The DPA clarified that the platform is intended to enable the exchange of contact information in order to make job offers. In contrast, it is not intended that users use the platform to send messages to other users in order to sell services. Moreover, it is irrelevant whether a user profile is public or not. Consequently, the DPA concluded that the controller had processed the data unlawfully.;https://www.gpdp.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9705632

The draft primarily addresses the fact that Facebook has included details on data processing in its terms of service, thus relying on Art. 6 (1) b) rather than on consent pursuant to Art. 6 (1) a) GDPR. 
Critics consider this a loophole used by Facebook to circumvent the stricter GDPR requirements of consent according to Art. 6 (1) a) GDPR.

However, the DPC emphasizes that the GDPR does not establish a hierarchy of legal bases that can be used to process personal data.

Yet, the DPC noted that Facebook failed to provide clear information about its legal basis for data processing and highlights that the information provided by Facebook is discontinuous and that users are referred to different documents and texts of the data policy and terms of service. 

The DPC concludes its draft that Facebook has thus violated Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR, Art. 12 (1) GDPR and Art. 13 (1) c) GDPR.

The draft decision will now be forwarded to other European data protection authorities allowing them to comment on it.";https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2021-10/IN%2018-5-5%20Draft%20Decision%20of%20the%20IE%20SA.pdf

Art. 2-sexies Codice della Privacy;Non-compliance with general data processing principles;"The Italian DPA (Garante) has imposed a fine of EUR 200,000 on Bocconi University. A student had filed a complaint with the DPA about possible GDPR violations related to the use of a monitoring system during written exams. In the context of the emergency situation triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, the university had equipped itself with the remote monitoring software Respondus provided by the American company Respondus Inc. to ensure the normal running of the exams, since it was not possible to take the exams live and in person as usual. The software was able to monitor the behavior of the students through video recordings and snapshots taken at random intervals. In addition, the exam was audio-visually recorded and a photograph was taken of each examinee at the beginning of the exam. At the end of the exam, the system processed the video, inserted warning signals regarding possible indications of incorrect behavior, and, among other things, assigned a so-called 'review priority' so that the examiner could subsequently assess whether an unauthorized act had been committed during the exam. In its investigation the DPA found that students were not properly informed of the processing of their personal data involved in the use of Respondus. For instance they were not informed that they would be audiovisually recorded and that the images would subsequently be processed. In addition, students were not provided with information regarding specific retention periods for personal data. Nor had they received sufficient information about the fact that their personal data would be transferred to the United States; instead, they were only informed in general terms that personal data would be processed both within and outside the territory of the European Union. Furthermore, the DPA found that the little information the students had received was presented in a fragmented and disorganized manner in various documents. The DPA considered this to be a violation of the principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency. The DPA also found that the university had processed the personal data without a valid legal basis. Thus, consent to the processing of personal data was a prerequisite to participate in the exams in the first place. As an alternative to online exams, the option of an in-person exam was proposed. However, in the light of the  pandemic, this also meant an increased health risk. Students were also concerned that refusing to take the online exams would negatively impact their grades. Consequently, the DPA concluded that the students' consent could not be considered voluntary. Further, the DPA found that the university retained the data for 12 months, although this would not have been necessary for the purpose of ensuring that the exams were properly carried out. 
Eventually, the DPA found violations related to the transfer of data to Respondus. The processing agreement between the University and Respondus was based on the data protection agreement between the EU and the USA, known as the Privacy Shield, although it had been declared invalid by the Schrems II ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). For this reason, the DPA found that the university transferred personal data to a third country, even though this transfer was not in compliance with the conditions set forth in Chapter V of the GDPR.";https://www.gpdp.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9703988

EUR 3,296,326 for illegal telemarketing. 
The DPA's decision followed a complex investigation launched after dozens of reports and complaints from people who claimed that they received unsolicited promotional calls and promotional SMS both from Sky Italia directly and through call centers of other companies. 
In this regard, the DPA found that the promotional calls were made without adequately informing the users (such as about the origin of the personal data transmitted to Sky Italia). Thus, data subjects would have had the opportunity to contact the company that collected the data and object to the processing.  Only after obtaining consent, Sky would then have been allowed to proceed with the commercial offers. 
Sky used lists of data it had acquired from other companies for these promotional purposes. Contrary to Sky Italia's view, the consent to the disclosure of data to third parties given by the data subjects to the companies from which Sky Italia had acquired the lists did not authorize Sky Italia to use the data for its own promotional purposes.
In addition, Sky failed to verify the list of individuals who had objected to being contacted for advertising purposes before making the advertising calls. As a result, several data subjects had received advertising calls despite their explicit objection. Further, the DPA found that Sky had failed to properly appoint the suppliers of the lists as data processors. 
In determining the amount of the fine, the DPA took into aggravating consideration that the violations involved 'systemic' conduct that was rooted in the company's operations as well as the fact that Sky should have acquired sufficient experience and competence to make fundamental decisions in compliance with data protection regulations due to its ongoing contacts with the authority and its long-standing presence in the market.";https://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9706389,

Caixabank had used individuals' data to assess their creditworthiness without their consent. This was used to create financial profiles of the data subjects and to advertise certain financial services (e.g. credit cards or loans) to them on this basis. 

In doing so, the DPA found that the controller had not obtained effective consent from the data subjects. It is true that the data subjects had at one point given consent for their data to be processed by the entire CaixaBank Group. However, the controller had not adequately informed the data subjects about the data processing, including profiling.

In 2019, the airline suffered a data breach, in which a hacker gained access to Transavia's systems through two accounts held by the company's IT department. This could have potentially allowed the hacker to access data such as names, dates of birth, gender, email addresses, phone numbers, flight information and booking numbers of 25 million passengers. It was found that the hacker actually downloaded the personal data of 83,000 people. In 367 cases, the data included medical information of people who had requested, for example, wheelchair transportation or additional services because they were blind or deaf. The DPA noted that a lack of security measures allowed the hacker to access the systems. Thus, it was possible to access the airline's systems simply by entering the password. The systems did not incorporate multi-factor authentication. Furthermore, the access rights of the accounts were not limited to necessary systems, allowing the hacker to use them to gain access to multiple Transavia systems.

In May 2020, a trade union filed a complaint with the CNIL alleging that the number of strike days exercised by staff were included in files used to prepare promotion decisions. The CNIL then conducted investigations in several RATP bus centers. These led to confirmation of this practice in three RATP bus centers. The CNIL indicated that files for evaluating performance and promotion prospects should only contain data necessary for evaluating employees.In particular, it was sufficient to indicate the total number of days of absence without the need to go into detail and distinguish the days associated with the exercise of the right to strike. It found that the use of data on the number of days staff members were on strike was not necessary for these purposes, and that the RATP thus violated the principle of data minimization set forth in Article 5 (1) (c) GDPR. In addition, the DPA found that the RATP had excessively retained many of its employees' data. Indeed, the RATP kept files on the evaluation of staff members for more than three years after the promotion commission, although their retention was only required for 18 months after the holding of these commissions. Further, CNIL found that RATP did not adequately differentiate between staff authorization levels, allowing more staff than necessary to access certain data. For this reason, CNIL concluded that RATP failed in its duty to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.;https://www.cnil.fr/fr/fichiers-devaluation-des-agents-sanction-de-400-000-euros-lencontre-de-la-ratp

A data subject had filed a complaint against the data controller due to the fact that telephone lines were registered in his name, although he had never concluded contracts with the company for any of these lines. Vodafone had accidentally assigned the data of the data subject to the contracts of another Vodafone customer, which is why the contracts went under his name. Against this background, the DPA considered the processing of the data subject's data by Vodafone to be unlawful.

A data subject filed a complaint with the DPA against the company after they had denied him a financial transaction due to alleged outstanding payments on a loan. As it turned out, an identity thief had obtained the data subject's data without authorization and applied for a loan from the data controller under pretense of the data subject's identity. The controller then approved the loan. Since the data processed in the course of granting the loan did not belong to the borrower but to the data subject, the AEPD found that the controller had no legal basis for processing the data. The processing was therefore unlawful and a breach of Art. 6 (1) GDPR was affirmed. The original fine of EUR 40,000 was reduced to EUR 24,000 due to the immediate payment and the admission of guilt.;https://www.aepd.es/es/documento/ps-00487-2021.pdf

In the context of childcare benefit applications, tax offices had processed data on the dual nationality of applicants for several years.

However, the DPA found that the data on dual nationality of Dutch citizens would not have been necessary when assessing an application for childcare benefits.

The said data had also been processed for the purpose of combating organized fraud and for automatic classification in the authority's risk system. However, even for these purposes, the processing would not have been necessary. 

For this reason, the tax and customs administration should have deleted the data on dual nationality as early as January 2014. Nevertheless, as of May 2018, the dual citizenship data of a total of 1,4 million people were still registered in the systems of the tax and customs administration.

The DPA therefore found that the data had been unlawfully processed due to the lack of a valid legal basis.

For example, the controller had collected health-related information on disability pensions, although this was not required.  Approximately 24,000 individuals were affected by these incidents.

Grindr is a location-based social networking app designed for gay, bi, trans and queer people.  In 2020, the Norwegian Consumer Protection Authority filed a complaint against Grindr with the Norwegian DPA, alleging that the portal had shared information about users' GPS location, IP address, cell phone advertising ID, age and gender with several third parties for marketing purposes. 

Under GDPR, consent is required for the sharing of this personal data. However, during its investigation, the DPA found that the consent collected by Grindr was not valid. 

Users had to accept the privacy policy in order to use the app, but were not explicitly asked whether they would consent to their data being shared with third parties for marketing purposes. In addition, the information about the disclosure of personal data was not clear or accessible enough for users. 


The DPA points out that this type of data may identify a Grindr user as a member of a sexual minority. Grindr users would sometimes want to use the app anonymously without, for example, giving their full name or uploading a photo of themselves. With the sexual orientation of the users, a special category of personal data, which is subject to a particularly high level of protection, was therefore also affected. 

The DPA therefore considers the infringement to be a particularly serious case that justifies a deterrent high fine. Business models based on behavior-based marketing are widespread in the digital economy, making it important that the fines for GDPR violations are deterrent.";https://www.datatilsynet.no/contentassets/8ad827efefcb489ab1c7ba129609edb5/administrative-fine---grindr-llc.pdf

In September 2020, the psychotherapy center reported an attack on its patient database to the DPA. An unauthorized third party had gained access to Vastaamo's medical database on at least two occasions, in December 2018 and March 2019. The attacker had also siphoned off data and left a ransom note on the servers. Due to insufficient logging, neither the exact date of the breach nor the network addresses used by the attacker could be identified.

The most likely cause of the medical database leak was an unprotected port on the database where the root user account of the database was not password protected. The patient database server was open to the Internet without firewall protection during the period between November 26, 2017, and March 13, 2019.

For this reason, the DPA determined that the personal data were not adequately protected against unauthorized and unlawful processing or accidental loss, destruction, or damage, and that the controller had not implemented basic measures for the secure processing of personal data.

As part of its investigation, the DPA also determined that the controller must have known as early as March 2019 that data in the patient information system had been lost and could have been compromised by an external attacker. Vastaamo should have immediately reported the security breach to both the DPA and its patients. However, Vastaamo was significantly late in meeting this obligation. 

The fine is composed proportionately of EUR 145, 600 for the breach of Art. 33 (1) GDPR, EUR 145, 600 for the breach of Art. 34 (1) GDPR and EUR 316, 800 for the breach of Art. 5 (1) f) GDPR.";https://finlex.fi/fi/viranomaiset/tsv/2021/20211183

The CNIL received several complaints regarding the manner in which cookies could be refused on the website of Facebook.com.

The CNIL subsequently conducted an online review of the websites and found that, although the websites offered a button to accept cookies immediately, there was no equivalent solution that would allow the Internet user to reject the deposit of cookies just as easily. Rather, several clicks were required to reject all cookies, in contrast to a single click to accept them.

From this, the CNIL concluded that users would accept the deposit of cookies out of convenience with more frequency. It considered that the design of the cookie deposit interferes with the freedom of consent of Internet users and constitutes a violation of Art. 82 of the French Law on Informatics and Freedoms.

In determining the fine, the fact that a large number of people were affected was taken into account in an aggravating manner. In addition, the CNIL took into account the significant profits that the companies were able to make from the advertising revenue generated indirectly from the data collected through cookies.

The CNIL also pointed to the fact that the authority had already alerted the the company to this breach in February 2021. 

In addition to the fine, the CNIL issued an order requiring the companies to provide Internet users in France with a way to reject cookies as easily as they can accept them, within three months of being notified of the decision. Otherwise, companies would face the payment of a penalty of EUR 100,000 per day of delay.";https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/cnil/id/CNILTEXT000044840532
